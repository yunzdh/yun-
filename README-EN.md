# GKI KernelSU SUSFS

Automated GKI kernel build repository.

> Not supported on OnePlus ColorOS 14/15. You may need to wipe data after flashing.
>

> SUKISU builds: `stable` uses the `builtin` branch (high bootloop risk); `dev` uses the `tmp-builtin` branch (more stable, but untouched for two weeks).

Attempted to build a GKI kernel with [hymo](https://github.com/Anatdx/hymo) integration. Since the project only supports kernel 6.6, it is not fully merged into the main branch.
Reference release: [hymo+gki](https://github.com/zzh20188/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-r19)
